Building website for my significant others hobby, and using this project as a basis to learn web development and to get into the development world.

This project is my attempt to use as much vanilla JS without frameworks.
Backend will be re-written to GO once I'm happy with front end.
Backend is currently just running the main functions needed for front end to work with enquires, and gallery delivery.

Obviously, being a novice I'm still using some library's to get me started.

Current library list:
Bootstrap 5.3
Flatpicker (Calender)
SQL (raw SQL no ORM)
Google API's
Express JS

Current runtime:
Node JS

Database:
MySQL
