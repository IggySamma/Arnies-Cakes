Building website for my significant others hobby, and using this project as a basis to learn web development and to get into the development world.

This project is my attempt to use as much vanilla JS without frameworks.

Obviously, being a novice I'm still using some library's to get me started.

Current library list:
Bootstrap 5.3
Flatpicker (Calender)
//MySQL
MySql2
Google API's
Express JS

Current runtime:
Node JS

Database:
MySQL
