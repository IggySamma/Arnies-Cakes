Project Overview:

	This project is focused on building a website for my significant other's hobby. It serves as both a personal endeavor to support their interests and a learning platform for me to explore and deepen my understanding of web development. The goal is to gain practical experience and transition into the development world.

Technological Approach:

	In this project, my goal is to primarily utilize vanilla JavaScript, minimizing reliance on external frameworks. To enhance development efficiency and ensure a polished, functional result, I am incorporating a select set of essential libraries.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

	Frontend:

		Bootstrap 5.3: For responsive and modern UI components.

		Flatpicker: Lightweight calendar and date picker for user interaction.

	Backend:

		Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.

		Express.js: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.

		EJS: Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML pages.

	Database:

		MySQL: Relational database management system.

		MySQL2: MySQL client for Node.js, supporting prepared statements and promises.

	APIs:

		Google APIs: Integration for additional functionality, including authentication and more.


Future Goals:

	As I continue to develop this project, my primary objectives are to enhance my skills in JavaScript, improve my understanding of web technologies, and eventually expand into more advanced development frameworks and practices.
